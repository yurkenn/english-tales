            'High above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince. He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.',
            'He was very much admired indeed. "He is as beautiful as a weathercock," remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; "only not quite so useful," he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.',

            'After they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love. "She has no conversation," he said, "and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind."',
            '"Will you come away with me?" he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her head, she was so attached to her home. "You have been trifling with me," he cried. "I am off to the Pyramids. Good-bye!" and he flew away.',
            'All day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city. "Where shall I put up?" he said; "I hope the town has made preparations." Then he saw the statue on the tall column. "I will put up there," he cried; "it is a fine position, with plenty of fresh air."',
            'But just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop of water fell on him. "What a curious thing!" he cried; "there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining."',
            'Then another drop fell. He looked up, and saw—Ah! what did he see? The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks.',
            '"Who are you?" he said. "I am the Happy Prince." "Why are you weeping then?" asked the Swallow; "you have quite drenched me."',
            '"When I was alive and had a human heart," answered the statue, "I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter. Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful. My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness. So I lived, and so I died. And now that I am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot choose but weep."',
            '"Far away," continued the statue in a low musical voice, "far away in a little street there is a poor house. One of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table. Her face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a seamstress. In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill. He has a fever, and is asking for oranges. His mother has nothing to give him but river water, so he is crying. Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt? My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move."',
            '"I am waited for in Egypt," said the Swallow. But the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry. "It is very cold here," he said; "but I will stay with you for one night, and be your messenger."',
            'So the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince\'s sword, and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town. At last he came to the poor house and looked in. The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired. In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman\'s thimble. Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy\'s forehead with his wings.',
            'Then the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince. "It is curious," he remarked, "but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold." "That is because you have done a good action," said the Prince.',
            'The next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour. When the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince. "Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince, "far away across the city I see a young man in a garret. He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets. His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes. He is trying to finish a play for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any more. There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint."',
            '"I will wait with you one night longer," said the Swallow. "Shall I take him another ruby?" "Alas! I have no ruby now," said the Prince; "my eyes are all that I have left. They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago. Pluck out one of them and take it to him. He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish his play."',
            '"Dear Prince," said the Swallow, "I cannot do that"; and he began to weep. "Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince, "do as I command you."',
            'So the Swallow plucked out the Prince\'s eye, and flew away to the student\'s garret. The young man had his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the bird\'s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered violets. "I am beginning to be appreciated," he cried; "this is from some great admirer. Now I can finish my play."',
            '"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince, "in the square below there stands a little match-girl. She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled. Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying. She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare. Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will not beat her."',
            '"I will stay with you one night longer," said the Swallow, "but I cannot pluck out your eye. You would be quite blind then." "Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince, "do as I command you."',
            'So he plucked out the Prince\'s other eye, and darted down with it. He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand. "What a lovely bit of glass," cried the little girl; and she ran home, laughing.',
            'Then the Swallow came back to the Prince. "You are blind now," he said, "so I will stay with you always." "No, little Swallow," said the poor Prince, "you must go away to Egypt." "I will stay with you always," said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince\'s feet.',
            'All the next day he sat on the Prince\'s shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands. "Dear little Swallow," said the Prince, "you tell me of marvellous things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women. There is no Mystery so great as Misery. Fly over my city, little Swallow, and tell me what you see there."',
            'So the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates. He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets.',
            '"I am covered with fine gold," said the Prince, "you must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold can make them happy."',
            'Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey. Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the children\'s faces grew rosier, and they laughed and played games in the street. "We have bread now!" they cried.',
            'Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost. The poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he loved him too well. He picked up crumbs outside the baker\'s door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.',
            'But at last he knew that he was going to die. He had just strength to fly up to the Prince\'s shoulder once more. "Good-bye, dear Prince!" he murmured, "will you let me kiss your hand?" "I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow," said the Prince, "you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips, for I love you."',
            '"It is not to Egypt that I am going," said the Swallow. "I am going to the House of Death. Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?" And he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his feet.',
            'At that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken. The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two. It certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.',
            'Early the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors. As they passed the column he looked up at the statue: "Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!" he said.',
            '"The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is golden no longer," said the Mayor; "in fact, he is little better than a beggar!" "Little better than a beggar," said the Town Councillors.',
            '"And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!" continued the Mayor. "We must really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die here." And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.',
            'So they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince. "As he is no longer beautiful he is no longer useful," said the Art Professor at the University.',
            'Then they melted the statue in a furnace. "What a strange thing!" said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry. "This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace. We must throw it away." So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also lying.',
            '"Bring me the two most precious things in the city," said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.',
            '"You have rightly chosen," said God, "for in my garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy Prince shall praise me."',

            'The poor children had now nowhere to play. They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it. They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside. "How happy we were there," they said to each other.',
            'Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still Winter. The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom. Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep.',
            'The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. "Spring has forgotten this garden," they cried, "so we will live here all the year round." The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver. Then they invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came. He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down.',
            '"I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming," said the Selfish Giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden; "I hope there will be a change in the weather." But the Spring never came, nor the Summer. The Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but to the Giant\'s garden she gave none. "He is too selfish," she said. So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.',
            'One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music. It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King\'s musicians passing by. It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world. Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement. "I believe the Spring has come at last," said the Giant; and he jumped out of bed and looked out.',
            'What did he see? He saw a most wonderful sight. Through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the trees. In every tree that he could see there was a little child. And the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above the children\'s heads. The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing.',
            'It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still Winter. It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy. He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly. The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it. "Climb up! little boy," said the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the little boy was too tiny.',
            'And the Giant\'s heart melted as he looked out. "How selfish I have been!" he said; "now I know why the Spring would not come here. I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children\'s playground for ever and ever." He was really very sorry for what he had done.',
            'So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden. But when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became Winter again. Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming. And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree.',
            'And the tree broke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant\'s neck, and kissed him. And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring. "It is your garden now, little children," said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall.',
            'And when the people were going to market at twelve o\'clock they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen. All day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to bid him good-bye.',
            '"But where is your little companion?" he said: "the boy I put into the tree." The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him. "We don\'t know," answered the children; "he has gone away." "You must tell him to be sure and come here to-morrow," said the Giant. But the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.',
            'Every afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with the Giant. But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again. The Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first little friend, and often spoke of him. "How I would like to see him!" he used to say.',
            'Years went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble. He could not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the children at their games, and admired his garden. "I have many beautiful flowers," he said; "but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all."',
            'One winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing. He did not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring asleep, and that the flowers were resting. Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked. It certainly was a marvellous sight. In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms. Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved.',
            'Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden. He hastened across the grass, and came near to the child. And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, "Who hath dared to wound thee?" For on the palms of the child\'s hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet.',
            '"Who hath dared to wound thee?" cried the Giant; "tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him." "Nay!" answered the child; "but these are the wounds of Love."',
            '"Who art thou?" said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child. And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, "You let me play once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise."',
            'And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.',

            'The Nightingale spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air. She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden.',
            'In the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray. "Give me a red rose," she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."',
            'But the Tree shook its head. "My roses are white," it answered; "as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain. But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want."',
            'So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the old sun-dial. "Give me a red rose," she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song." But the Tree shook its head. "My roses are yellow," it answered.',
            'So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath the Student\'s window. "Give me a red rose," she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."',
            'But the Tree shook its head. "My roses are red," it answered, "as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern. But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year."',
            '"One red rose is all I want," cried the Nightingale, "only one red rose! Is there no way by which I can get it?"',
            '"There is a way," answered the Tree; "but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you." "Tell it to me," said the Nightingale, "I am not afraid."',
            '"If you want a red rose," said the Tree, "you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart\'s-blood. You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn. All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine."',
            '"Death is a great price to pay for a red rose," cried the Nightingale, "and Life is very dear to all. Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?"',
            'So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air. She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through the grove.',

So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her. Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.',

            '"Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful," said the Student angrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.',
            '"What a silly thing Love is," said the Student as he walked away. "It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true. In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics."',

            'But there was one Elephant—a new Elephant—an Elephant\'s Child—who was full of insatiable curiosity, and that means he asked ever so many questions.',
            'He asked his tall aunt, the Ostrich, why her tail-feathers grew just so, and his tall aunt the Ostrich spanked him with her hard, hard claw. He asked his tall uncle, the Giraffe, what made his skin spotty, and his tall uncle, the Giraffe, spanked him with his hard, hard hoof.',
            'And still he was full of insatiable curiosity! He asked his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, why her eyes were red, and his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, spanked him with her broad, broad hoof.',
            'One fine morning this insatiable Elephant\'s Child asked a new fine question that he had never asked before. He asked, "What does the Crocodile have for dinner?" Then everybody said, "Hush!" in a loud and dreadful tone, and they spanked him immediately.',

            'At last he came to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River. The first thing that he found was a Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake curled round a rock.',
            '"Excuse me," said the Elephant\'s Child most politely, "but have you seen such a thing as a Crocodile in these parts?" "Have I seen a Crocodile?" said the Snake, in a voice of dreadful scorn. "What will you ask me next?"',
            'Then he trod on what he thought was a log of wood at the very edge of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River. But it was really the Crocodile, and the Crocodile winked one eye.',

            'Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there lived a wealthy merchant who had three daughters. The youngest daughter, called Beauty, was not only the most beautiful but also the kindest and most humble of the three.',
            'One terrible winter, the merchant lost all his fortune when his ships were destroyed in a storm. The family had to move to a small cottage in the countryside, where they lived very simply.',
            'Years later, the merchant received news that one of his ships had been found with some of his goods aboard. He set off to the city to claim his fortune, and before leaving, he asked his daughters what gifts they would like.',
            'The two elder daughters asked for fine dresses and jewels. But Beauty asked only for a single rose, for none grew in their garden.',
            'The merchant\'s business went badly, and he found himself as poor as before. On his journey home through a dark forest, he became lost in a terrible snowstorm. Just when he thought he would perish, he came upon a magnificent castle.',
            'The castle door opened by itself, and inside he found a fire burning brightly and a table laden with food. He ate and rested, and in the morning, wandering through the garden, he saw a beautiful rose bush.',
            'Remembering Beauty\'s request, he plucked a single rose. At that moment, a terrifying Beast appeared before him. "You dare to steal my roses?" the Beast roared. "For this, you must die!"',
            'The merchant begged for mercy, explaining about his daughter\'s simple wish. The Beast considered this and made a proposal: "You may go free if one of your daughters comes willingly to live here in your place. Otherwise, you must return in three months to face your doom."',
            'The merchant returned home and told his daughters what had happened. Though her sisters were too frightened, Beauty insisted on taking her father\'s place. "It was my rose that caused this trouble," she said. "I will go to the Beast."',
            'When Beauty arrived at the castle, she expected to be treated cruelly. Instead, she found herself given a beautiful room filled with everything she could want — books, musical instruments, fine clothes, and the most wonderful garden.',
            'Every evening, the Beast would join her for dinner. Though his appearance was frightening, his manner was gentle and kind. He would ask her about her day and listen with genuine interest to her thoughts and dreams.',
            'Each night, the Beast would ask her the same question: "Beauty, will you marry me?" And each night, Beauty would gently refuse, saying she could only think of him as a friend.',
            'As months passed, Beauty grew genuinely fond of the Beast. She no longer feared him and even looked forward to their evening conversations. But she missed her family terribly.',
            'The Beast, seeing her sadness, allowed her to return home for one week to visit her father, who had fallen ill with worry. He gave her a magic mirror and a ring, warning her that if she did not return within a week, he would die of grief.',
            'Beauty\'s visit home was joyful, but her jealous sisters tricked her into staying longer than a week. On the night of the tenth day, Beauty looked into the magic mirror and saw the Beast lying motionless in his garden.',

            '"You have broken the spell," the prince said softly. "A wicked enchantress cursed me to live as a beast until someone could love me for who I truly am. Your love has set me free."',
            'Beauty and her prince were married in a grand celebration. Her father came to live with them in the castle, and even her sisters were forgiven and found happiness.',
            'And so Beauty discovered what she had known all along — that true beauty lies not in appearance, but in a kind and loving heart.',
